# Whether_App_using_Kotlin
A simple whether app which allows you to know whether details of any location you want to.
It consists of a simple place picker activity which can locate co-ordinates of any location and an OpenWhetherMap Api will fetch the whether details at those co-ordinates.
Also, I have added some animation features to make it little fun and interesting !!
